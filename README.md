# Wild Trivia 
A two weeks group project developed with ReactJS, remotely, during the Web Development course at *Wild Code School - Lisbon* by **André Pereira** and **Filipa Marta**. You can check our project live here (at Netlify): https://wild-trivia.netlify.app/


#### // The Idea
The request for this project was to fetch data from an API and after brainstorm, we chose Open Trivia API (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). Trivia is a people gatherer. We believe that’s important because, with the advent of technology, people tend to alienate social interaction. So we created **Wild Trivia**, a React JS app, to boost this interaction in the digital world, stimulate the brain and have fun while doing so.

#### // The Development
We draw wireframes and the components tree. We setup the GitHub environment using Git and an organization account with two branches: master (blocked for commits) and dev. To build the project we used Netlify. We setup a Trello board with Scrum and defined the boilerplate for the project with React (React Router, React Hooks, React Context), Bootstrap, SASS, HTML, Google fonts. We used Visual Code Studio to write the code and for visual interface design, Sketch. To prepare the presentation we used Google Slides. Everything in this project was made remotely through Google Hangouts meetings.


#### // Our Role
We worked together on the brainstorm, wireframes, setup the GitHub and Trello environment. We worked together on the set up of the React App as well as main major components to do the MVP (minimal viable product) to GET the information from the API and the game working. Web design, styles & animations, html architecture (responsive included) and UX of the application was managed by Filipa. André Pereira also worked on the Modal’s contribution to a good UX. We worked all together remotely, taking doubts, discussing ideas and being there to one another when Git came into stage. Together we presented our project to Lisbon campus and on May 15th, 2020.
