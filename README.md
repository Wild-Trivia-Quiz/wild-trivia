# Wild Trivia

A two weeks group project developed with ReactJS, remotely, during the Web Development course at _Wild Code School - Lisbon_ by **André Pereira** and **Filipa Marta**. You can check our project live here (at Netlify): https://wild-trivia.netlify.app/

#### // The Idea

The request for this project was to fetch data from an API and after brainstorming, we chose Open Trivia API (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). Trivia is a people gatherer. We believe that’s important because, with the advent of technology, people tend to alienate social interaction. So we created **Wild Trivia**, a React JS app, to boost this interaction in the digital world, stimulate the brain and have fun while doing so.

#### // The Development

We drew wireframes and the components tree. We setup the GitHub environment using Git and an organization account with two branches: master (blocked for commits) and dev. To build the project we used Netlify. We set up a Trello board with Scrum and defined the boilerplate for the project with React (React Router, React Hooks, React Context), Bootstrap, SASS, HTML, Google fonts. We used Visual Code Studio to write the code and for visual interface design, Sketch. To prepare the presentation we used Google Slides. Everything in this project was made remotely through Google Hangouts meetings.

#### // Our Role

We worked together on the brainstorming, wireframes, setting up the GitHub and Trello environment. We worked together on the set up of the React App as well as major components for the MVP (minimal viable product) to GET the information from the API and the make game work. Web design, styles & animations, html architecture (responsive included) and UX was managed by Filipa. André Pereira also worked on the Modal’s contribution to a good UX. We all worked together remotely, taking doubts, discussing ideas, resolving problems and being there for one another when Git came into stage. Together we presented our project to the Lisbon campus on May 15th, 2020.
